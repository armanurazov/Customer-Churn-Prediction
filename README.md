# Customer-Churn-Prediction

A customer churn predictive model using decision trees in a telecom company is a machine learning model that aims to identify which customers are likely to leave the company based on their past behavior and demographics. The model uses decision trees to create a flowchart of decisions that lead to a prediction of whether a customer is likely to churn or not. Factors such as call duration, monthly bill, tenure, and type of plan may be considered as variables in the decision tree. This model can help the company identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering personalized promotions or improving customer service.
